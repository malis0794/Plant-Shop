# Plant-Shop

I have created Plant Shop Ecommerce using Reactjs.

I have focused on the functionality side of things as supposed to the visual so the images and items aren't related to the appropriate business.
The images were pulled using a .json file provided by sources we use at the company for quick testing.

To Do:
1. Change the .json file to incorporate 'Plantee's' images.
2. Fix checkout total output
3. Fix the payment function (fake payment).
4. Re-design layout

To Setup:
1. Clone repo.
2. Delete 'package-lock.json'
3. Delete 'yarn.lock'
4. Delete 'node_modules'
5. Check if you have '.env' file - if not create one and add "SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true" in it and save.
6. Go to terminal and input 'npm install' -> 'yarn install'
7. You are ready to go -> 'yarn start'
